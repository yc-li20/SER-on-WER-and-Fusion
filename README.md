Bimodal fusion code for paper "Speech Emotion Recognition with ASR Transcripts: A Comprehensive Study on Word Error Rate and Fusion Techniques"

- All bimodal fusion techniques are in ```fusions_bimodal.py```.
- The **ASR error correction** model is from [Crossmodal ASR Error Correction with Discrete Speech Units](https://github.com/yc-li20/Crossmodal_AEC)
- The **Modality-gated fusion** is adapted from [Cross-Attention is Not Enough: Incongruity-Aware Dynamic Hierarchical Fusion for Multimodal Affect Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13583)
